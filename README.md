# multirobot_auction_tasks
The robots coordinate to cover specific locations in a common reference frame. One robot is an auctioneer and other robots bid on a single location independently. The auctioneer assigns a task to robots following "sequential auction" mechanism until each task is allocated to a robot. Check out media/3robots_seq_auction.mp4 for a demo on 3 robots in an empty world in gazebo simulator.
